# Robofriends - Simple Starter React App 

This app shows cards of different robots with names and emails shown. 
The list of robots is searchable by their name with immediate results as you type in the search box.

Jsonplaceholder/users API is used to grab names and emails and robohash API is used to grab randomized robot pictures.

App state done with Redux.
